Udacity project to simulate home service robot capable of navigating to pick up and deliver virtual objects.
I summarize the functions in followings.

- Use the environment created in past projects.

- Teleoperate your robot and manually test SLAM.

- Use the ROS navigation stack and manually commands your robot using the 2D Nav Goal arrow in rviz to move to 2 different desired positions and orientations.

- Write a pick_objects node that commands your robot to move to the desired pickup and drop off zones.

- Write an add_markers node that subscribes to your robot odometry, keeps track of your robot pose, and publishes markers to rviz.
